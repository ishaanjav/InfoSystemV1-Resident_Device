# ResidentDevice
This is the repository for an Android Application. The purpose of this application is to serve as part of a system of 3 applications 
that informs patients with diseases such as Alzheimer's or dementia about visitors coming to the house since they have difficulties recognizing faces. In addition to providing the
visitor's name, the Alzheimer's patient will also receive a picture of the visitor, their contact details, and other information about
them such as their relation to the resident and an extedned description of themself. 

This app is meant to help the Alzheimer's patient not only see that a visitor has logged in, but also understand who they are. The app is useful because patients with Alzheimer's suffer
from memory loss due to the death of brain cells from a plaque containing beta amyloid. This app is able to provide useful information about
visitors that can not only help the patient identify who they are, but know who they are.
